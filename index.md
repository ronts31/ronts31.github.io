[![Download Stability First AI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Get%20the%20Latest%20Release-brightgreen)](https://github.com/ronts31/stability-first-ai/releases)

## 📋 Introduction

Welcome to **stability-first-ai**! This application helps solve complex problems in artificial intelligence. By using advanced techniques like Recursive Time architecture and Active Sleep, it proves that neural networks can remember information over time. This project focuses on reducing "catastrophic forgetting," which is when a model forgets previous knowledge as it learns new things. 

Whether you're interested in the latest in AI or want to experiment with neural networks, this guide will help you easily download and run our software.

## 🚀 Features

- **Active Sleep**: A method that allows models to practice past experiences, helping retain learned information.
- **Generative Replay**: This technique lets the model regenerate experiences, which improves memory.
- **Temporal LoRA**: It optimizes data usage, effectively enhancing the learning process.
- **Neuroscience-Inspired Design**: The architecture is based on methods used in human memory, allowing for better performance.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before downloading, ensure your system meets these basic requirements:

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Memory: At least 4 GB of RAM
- Disk Space: Minimum of 1 GB free space
